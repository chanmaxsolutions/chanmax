								<p>
									The prestigious award-winning Sri Lankan writer, Mr.
									N.Selvarajah uses the power of words to give life to the
									unknown. He has written more than 43 books and compiled
									several volumes of Noolthettam - a bibliography of Tamil
									publications of Sri Lankan Tamils. His works were in great
									demand in and across the borders. Thus he needed a platform
									for knowledge of inquisitive individuals around the world to
									get hold of the wisdom treasured in his works.

									Our team came forth to develop the electronic digital library
									- Noolthettam. The technological evolution and people’s
									knowledge on the availability and increased access to
									electronic text reinforced the success of this digital
									transition. The website was furnished to empower an
									extraordinary user experience and provide convenient access to
									the ebooks. The site houses several compilations of the
									author’s work committed to preserving the Tamil Publications.

									The digital Noolthettam was designed with a focus on giving a
